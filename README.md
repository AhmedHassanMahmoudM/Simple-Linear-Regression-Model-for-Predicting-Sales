Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset that includes advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper, and it predicts the resulting sales.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

TV: Advertising budget for TV (in thousands of dollars)
Radio: Advertising budget for Radio (in thousands of dollars)
Newspaper: Advertising budget for Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
Sales: The resulting sales (in thousands of units)
Model
The model uses the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn to predict sales based on the given advertising budgets. It is trained on historical data and can be used to make predictions on new data.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training the Model:

The training script is provided in train_model.py.
Run the script to train the model and save it as a .pkl file.
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Predicting with the Model:

Use the saved model to make predictions on new data.
python
Copy code
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the model
with open('linear_regression_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Predict new sales
prediction = model.predict(np.array([[TV, Radio, Newspaper]]))
print(f'The predicted sales is: {prediction[0]}')
Streamlit App
A simple web app is also provided using Streamlit to interactively predict sales based on user input for TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets.

To run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. You can view the results in the results folder or by running the evaluation script.
