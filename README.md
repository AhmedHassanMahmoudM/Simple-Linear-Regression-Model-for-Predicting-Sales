## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset that includes advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper, and it predicts the resulting sales.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- TV: Advertising budget for TV (in thousands of dollars)
- Radio: Advertising budget for Radio (in thousands of dollars)
- Newspaper: Advertising budget for Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
- Sales: The resulting sales (in thousands of units)

## Model
The model uses the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn to predict sales based on the given advertising budgets. It is trained on historical data and can be used to make predictions on new data.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. You can view the results in the results folder or by running the evaluation script.
